##CIFAR-10 CNN Classifier - Beginner Version

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving 72.19% accuracy on the test set. Designed as a beginner-friendly version, the model helps users understand how to build a CNN for image classification. The code includes comments throughout to provide clear explanations of each step, making it easier to follow and understand the underlying concepts. This project serves as a great starting point for those new to deep learning and PyTorch.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- torch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
	git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar10-cnn.git
2. Install dependencies:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the model:
	python src/train.py

## Results
After training, the model achieves a test accuracy of 72.19%.
This is a solid result for a beginner-level implementation, though there's potential to improve accuracy by optimizing the model further.
